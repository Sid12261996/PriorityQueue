# PriorityQueue
This is a basic implementation of Priority Queue using java

## Details
I am using Generic class concept on java to implement methods like show and compare. You can use any type of class for he generic PriorityQueue class. 
The basic functionality are added like `add` , `peek` and `remove`

## Metrics for PriorityQueue
add time complexity: `O(log n)`
remove time complexity: `O(log n)`
peek time complexity: `O(1)`


## Why should you usePriority Queue
Well! the biggest highlight is you can get the most prioritised element at O(1) complexity. Suitable for data strcutures where you have to constantly keep the most/least prioritised elements and return them frequently

## Applications
1. It is also use in Operating System for load balancing (load balancing on server), interrupt handling. (source GFG)
2. Implementation of few other algos like Prim's, Dijikstra's and Huffman Codes
